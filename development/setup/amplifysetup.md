# Setting Up an Amplify Full-Stack App
This guide walks you through creating a full-stack application using Amplify. We'll cover the essential steps to get your project up and running.

## Prerequisites:

An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your development machine.
Basic understanding of web development concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

## Steps:
 
### 1.Install the Amplify CLI:

### Open a terminal window and run the following command:
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

### 2.Initialize a New Project:

Navigate to your desired project directory and run:
amplify init

Follow the prompts to choose a project type (e.g., web app) and configure authentication settings (if applicable).

### 3.Define Your App Structure:

Amplify uses a directory structure to manage your project. It creates essential folders for your backend (API), frontend (client), and cloud resources.

### 4.Configure Your Backend (API):

Use the Amplify CLI to define your backend schema:

amplify add schema

## setting up amplify
### run these commands

amplify configure
press ENTER (x2)

Enter the access key of the newly created user: 

accessKeyId: (put_your_access_ID)
 secretAccessKey:  (put_your_access_KEY)
 (NOTE: these details will be provided by you admin)

 Profile Name:  default
(terminal will get exit() , run below commands)
 amplify pull

 Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile
 Please choose the profile you want to use default  
 Which app are you working on? (choose_your_app_name)
 Choose your default editor: Visual Studio Code     
Choose the type of app that you're building Â· javascript

### Please tell us about your project
 What javascript framework are you using  : react      
 Source Directory Path:  src
 Distribution Directory Path: dist  (make sure write this)
 Build Command:  npm.cmd run-script build
 Start Command: npm.cmd run-script start
No AppSync API configured. Please add an API
 Do you plan on modifying this backend? Yes
 Successfully pulled backend environment dev from the cloud.




### 5.Configure Authentication (Optional):

If your app requires user authentication, use Amplify to integrate a suitable service:
amplify add auth
Choose your preferred authentication method (e.g., Cognito) and configure its settings.

### 6. Develop Your Frontend:

Amplify generates a basic frontend application based on your chosen framework (e.g., React, Vue.js). You can customize and build upon this foundation to implement your app's functionalities.

### 7.Connect Frontend and Backend:

Amplify provides libraries to connect your frontend code to your backend API. Integrate these libraries and configure them to interact with your data models seamlessly.

### 8.Push Your App to the Cloud:

Once your app is ready, use the Amplify CLI to provision and deploy your backend and frontend resources to the cloud:

amplify push

This creates and configures cloud resources like databases, storage buckets, and hosting environments.

### 9.Test and Access Your App:

After successful deployment, Amplify provides you with the URL to access your hosted application. Test its functionality and ensure everything works as expected.

##Additional Notes:

Amplify offers a variety of features beyond these basic steps. Explore its documentation for functionalities like data storage (S3), analytics (Pinpoint), and machine learning integration (SageMaker).
Consider using a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage your codebase and track changes throughout the development process.
This guide provides a basic overview of setting up an Amplify full-stack app. Refer to the official Amplify documentation for detailed instructions and advanced configuration options.
